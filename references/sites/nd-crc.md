# Site: Notre Dame CRC (Center for Research Computing)

The user's primary cluster. Details below override the generic `references/sge.md` guidance — use them verbatim. Official docs: https://docs.crc.nd.edu (hardware: `/infrastructure/available_hardware.html`, UGE environment: `/infrastructure/crc_uge_env.html`). New-user orientation: see `nd-crc-user-docs.md`.

- **Scheduler**: UGE (Univa Grid Engine) — `#$` directives, `qsub`
- **Login hosts**: `crcfe01.crc.nd.edu`, `crcfe02.crc.nd.edu` (64-core AMD EPYC 7543, 256 GB); `daccssfe.crc.nd.edu` (64-core Intel, 3 TB RAM)
- **Module system**: environment modules (`module load ...`)
- **Conda envs**: typically under `/users/<netid>/.conda/envs/`; activate via `source "$(conda info --base)/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" && conda activate /users/<netid>/.conda/envs/<env>`

## Queues

| Queue | Purpose | Runtime limit | Hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| `long` | Primary general-access queue | 15 days | General-access nodes: 64-core AMD EPYC 7543, 256 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD (d32cepyc182–247) |
| `hpc` | HPC nodes | — | 48-core AMD EPYC 7451, 128 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD (d24cepyc067–140) |
| `largemem` | Large-memory jobs | — | 4 nodes: 64-core EPYC 7543, **2 TB RAM** each |
| `gpu` | GPU jobs | 4 days | 12 nodes: dual Xeon Gold 6326 (32 cores), 256 GB RAM, **4× NVIDIA A10 per node** (48 GPUs total) |

Host-group targeting is also supported, e.g. `#$ -q *@@general_access` or `#$ -q *@@crc_d32cepyc` (list with `qconf -shgrpl`); users can only submit to host groups their research group has access to (PI emails CRCSupport@nd.edu for access).

## Parallel environments

| PE | Use | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `smp` | Shared-memory, single node | Up to 64 cores on one machine |
| `mpi-24` | Multi-node MPI | Request in 24-core increments (matches 48-core hpc nodes) |
| `mpi-32` | Multi-node MPI | 32-core increments |
| `mpi-64` | Multi-node MPI | 64-core increments (matches 64-core general-access nodes) |
| `mpi` | General MPI | Size-unspecified |

Syntax: `#$ -pe smp 8`, `#$ -pe mpi-64 128`. The increment must match the target hardware — a 24-core server will not accept `mpi-32` requests. No PE = serial, 1 core. One thread per core on all CRC machines.

## Site-specific syntax

- **GPU request**: `#$ -l gpu_card=N` on `-q gpu` (docs use `gpu_card`; if a script with `-l gpu=` is encountered, verify the resource name with `qconf -sc`). Pair with `-pe smp <cores>` for CPU cores alongside the GPU.
- **Typical GPU job header** (matches the user's existing scripts): `-q gpu`, `-l gpu_card=1`, `-pe smp 2`, `-j y`, `-o logs/`, `-cwd`.

## Limits

- Max **50 concurrent running jobs** per user (across all queues)
- Max **2,000 tasks** in a single array job (`-t 1-2000` ceiling)

## HTCondor pool (offload high-throughput work off UGE)

Besides UGE, the CRC runs a large **HTCondor** pool — the right tool for many independent serial/threaded jobs (parameter sweeps, per-file/per-molecule work) that would otherwise saturate the `long` queue and the 50-job UGE cap. The client is on the `crcfe` login hosts at `/software/c/condor/.../bin` (`condor_submit`, `condor_q`, `condor_status`); submit from `crcfe01`/`crcfe02`. HTCondor 23.x, ~3530 slots (verify live with `condor_status`).

- **Shared filesystem**: every slot reports `FileSystemDomain == UidDomain == "nd.edu"`, so `/users`, `/groups`, and conda envs are visible pool-wide. Use `should_transfer_files = NO` with `initialdir` on a shared-FS path (no `transfer_input_files` needed); HTCondor then auto-adds `TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain` so jobs only land where those mounts exist. Confirm the model on any pool with `condor_status -af FileSystemDomain | sort | uniq -c`.
- **OS pin**: overwhelmingly RHEL9 with a few RHEL8 slots — set `requirements = (OpSysMajorVer == 9)` for binaries built on the EL9 login nodes / conda envs.
- **The environment is bare** (see `htcondor.md` → "The environment is bare"). Two gotchas hit CRC jobs specifically, both fixed in the wrapper:
  1. `$HOME` is unset → Open MPI codes (NWChem, etc.) abort in `opal_init`. Fix: `export HOME="$_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR"`.
  2. `conda` is **not** on PATH → activate properly by sourcing the base at `/software/c/conda/<ver>/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` (the shared `/software` = `superior-data:/primary_software` mount, visible pool-wide) then `conda activate /users/<netid>/.conda/envs/<env>`. A bare `PATH=$env/bin:$PATH` skips `activate.d` and leaves e.g. `NWCHEM_BASIS_LIBRARY` unset ("bas_tag_lib: failed opening basis file" → `MPI_ABORT`).
- **Concurrency** is governed by the pool's fair-share, *not* the 50-job UGE cap; use `max_idle` for very large sweeps (>~10k jobs) to keep the queue responsive.
- **Tightly-coupled MPI apps (NWChem, Global Arrays codes): run them SERIAL here.** The pool packs jobs and its node types behave very differently for multi-rank MPI: GPU nodes (`TotalGpus>0`, qa-a10/qa-l40s) crash Global Arrays ("Received an Error in Communication"); older `chas` nodes crawl and never reach SCF; only the AMD EPYC `cepyc` nodes run multi-rank at full speed — and even they collapse (~10000x slowdown, SCF setup 9068 s) when several 4-rank jobs pack onto one node and busy-wait. The reliable, high-throughput answer is one rank per job (`request_cpus = 1`): no inter-rank comms, so no crash/crawl/spin, and it packs cleanly. If you must stay multi-rank, pin `requirements = ... && regexp("cepyc", Machine)` and expect low concurrency. (NWChem memory varies widely with molecule size; `memory total 4000 mb` in the config is PER RANK. Auto-adapt with `request_memory = ifThenElse(MemoryUsage =?= undefined, 10240, 2*MemoryUsage)` + `periodic_release = (HoldReasonCode == 34) && (NumJobStarts < 6)` so a job that OOM-holds retries at ~2x its observed peak.)

## Known quirks

- AFS is being retired **May 2027** — don't build new workflows on AFS paths.
- GPU nodes have 4 A10s each with 32 CPU cores — requesting more than 8 cores per GPU (`-pe smp`) oversubscribes the node's CPU/GPU ratio.
